        <h2>The Best Flavor</h2>
            <p>There is nothing more well loved than a tasty plate of salmon in my house. But the one above all is this simple but very tasty recipe. The flavor is full bodied and although sweet isn't overpowering. Its safe to say ive turned salmon haters into fenatics over night. The salmon in the end will easily pull apart and melt into your mouth. This recipe is not one to pass up on.</p>
